// Notes:
//   Each store will be represented by a file. This means it's possible to have items in a store that we don't know about yet. Such items will be deleted from the store if the store is loaded and then saved.
//   We only need to load the locations of the current store into memory.
//   Deleting an item would be expensive if we had to delete the item from each store. Instead we do this lazily.
//   Each store contains a dictionary of aisleName: String -> [itemName: String] plus a GPS location
//   Any item which is on the list but is not in any aisle is in the Unknown section
//   The user's list is an array [item: Item]
//   An item has a name, and an optional description
